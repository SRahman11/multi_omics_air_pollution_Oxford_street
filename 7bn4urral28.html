<div>Due to the confounding effect of location on the different OMICs, only location-stratified sPLS results will be investigated from here. Furthermore, since the Q2 score of the models belonging to miRNA(X)-adducts(Y) and metabolites(X)-mRNA(Y) are negative for either Oxford Street or Hyde Park, they will also be excluded from analyses.</div><div></div><div>Figure 22 shows the number of selected metabolites by the Oxford Street and Hyde Park metabolite(X)-adduct(Y) models. Although there were no metabolites common to both locations, the Oxford Street model appears to have selected significantly more metabolites. Since Oxford Street has higher levels of TRAP exposure, this could indicate&nbsp;</div><div></div>
