<div>Due to the confounding effect of location on the different OMICs, only location-stratified sPLS results will be investigated from here. Furthermore, since the Q2 score of the models belonging to miRNA(X)-adducts(Y) and metabolites(X)-mRNA(Y) are negative for either Oxford Street or Hyde Park, they will also be excluded from analyses.</div><div></div><div>Figure 22 shows the number of selected metabolites by the Oxford Street and metabolite(X)-mRNA(X) model in Oxford Street and Hyde Park. Among the metabolites, three were selected in both locations.</div>
