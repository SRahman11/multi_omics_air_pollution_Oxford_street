<div>We developed networks to provide an integrative approach to the analysis. From our network analysis we can see that that there is no clear pattern of significance between the different compounds and traps. The most interesting network analysis is seen in Figure 15, where associations between TRAP-associated biomarkers were stratified according to health status COPD/IHD/Healthy. From the figure</div><div></div><div>Health status was controlled for in our initial univariate analysis, and our sample size is too small to permit meaningful stratified analysis of TRAP-OMIC relationships. However, differential network analysis reveals associations between TRAP-associated biomarkers that vary significantly between health status strata.&nbsp; Figure 15 shows this differential network, which includes a clear cluster of metabolites whose relationships are significantly influenced by health status.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>From our multivariate analyses, &nbsp;where we ran the sPLS model on the data that had been denoised for biological and technical confounders we found that &nbsp;there were some significance reported amongst metabolites, adductomics and &nbsp;miRNA mainly. &nbsp;For example, as seen in Figure 17{describe some PLS] here.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="167044" class="ltx_title_section">Conclusion:</h1>
