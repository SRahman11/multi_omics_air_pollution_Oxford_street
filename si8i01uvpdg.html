<div></div><div>Associations between exposure and OMIC response were analysed using generalised least squares (GLS) regression models, incorporating a general unstructured variance-covariance matrix, which the transformation matrix is derived from, to account for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the data arising from an experimental&nbsp;design in which three repeated measurements were taken in two locations for each&nbsp;individual. The patient ID was used as a grouping factor to define the autocorrelation structure, in order to account for any covariance that exists among&nbsp;the error terms in the OMICs measurement within an individual. The three repeated measurements&nbsp;taken in two locations resulted in a grouping factor of&nbsp;six, which was used to define the heteroscedasticity structure or the weight each data point contributes to the modelon the prediction based on the variance of&nbsp;itsof the GLS model to&nbsp;a . and the three repeated measurements across two&nbsp;locations&nbsp; yielded a residual variance-covariance structure as described in figure 2.</div><div></div>
