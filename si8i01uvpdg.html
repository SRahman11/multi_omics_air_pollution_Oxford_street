<div></div><div>Associations between exposure and OMIC response were analysed using generalised least squares (GLS) regression models, incorporating a general unstructured variance-covariance matrix, which the transformation matrix is derived from, to account for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation in the data arising from an experimental&nbsp;design in which three repeated measurements were taken in two locations for each&nbsp;individual.&nbsp;Patient ID was used as a grouping factor to define the autocorrelation structure , and the six repeated measurements yielded a residual variance-covariance structure as described in figure 2.</div><div></div>
