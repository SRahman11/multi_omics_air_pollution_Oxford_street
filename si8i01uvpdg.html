<div></div><div>Associations between exposure and OMIC response were analysed using generalised least squares (GLS) regression models, incorporating a general unstructured variance-covariance matrix to account for the dependence among observations arising from the repeated measures design. Patient ID was used as a grouping factor, and the six repeated measurements yielded a variance-covariance structure shown in <code>figure 1</code>.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
