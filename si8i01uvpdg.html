<div>Associations between exposure and OMICs responses were analysed using mixed effect generalised least squares (GLS) regression models, incorporating a general unstructured variance-covariance matrix to account for the hierarchically structured data – and resultant correlated residuals – arising from an experimental&nbsp;design in which three repeated measurements were taken in two locations for each&nbsp;individual.&nbsp;The three repeated measurements&nbsp;taken in two locations resulted in a grouping factor of&nbsp;six, which was used to define the heteroscedasticity structure or the weight each data point contributes to the model based on the variance of its group membership. The residual variance-covariance structure is described in figure 2.</div><div></div>
