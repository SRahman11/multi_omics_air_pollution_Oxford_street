<div>OMICs measurement</div><div>For each participant and session, three blood serum samples were collected at two hours before the walk, two hours after, and 24 hours after, on which multi-omics measurements were taken, which included metabolomics, transcriptomics (mRNA and miRNA),&nbsp;and&nbsp;adductomics. Protocols for the metabolomic and miRNA measurements can be found&nbsp;in&nbsp;earlier articles by Veldhoven and&nbsp;Krauskopf,&nbsp; respectively&nbsp;<span class="au-font-blue" data-font-color="true">(Veldhoven, 2019)&nbsp;(Krauskopf, 2018)</span>. After removal and imputation of missing data, there remained full measurements&nbsp;for: 418 miRNAs; 30,981 mRNAs; 5,844 metabolites and 92&nbsp;adductomics.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="308247" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Covariates</h3><div>For each participant, measurements were taken for height, weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diasystolic blood pressure (DBP) and recent caffeine intake.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="229670" class="ltx_title_subsection">Statistical analysis</h2><h2 data-label="369918" class="ltx_title_subsection">OMICs Profiling</h2><div>After removing observations for any participants who were current smokers or who had incomplete measurements, data for 50 participants were analysed.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
