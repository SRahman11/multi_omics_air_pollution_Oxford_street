<div>To investigate and visualise biological pathways and relationships within and between OMICs levels, a range of network analysis techniques were applied. At the most basic level, marginal networks examined the pairwise relationships between biomarkers. P-values for covariance of each biomarker pairing were derived, and corrected for multiple testing using a Bonferroni adjustment. As four levels of OMIC were being analysed, the correlation matrix contained 10 inter-OMIC and intra-OMIC&nbsp;regions, and each region was adjusted for false discovery according to the size of the region (and therefore the number of tests conducted in that region). </div>
