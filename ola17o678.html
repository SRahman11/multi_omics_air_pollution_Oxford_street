<h3 data-label="823113" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">MicroRNAs</h3><div>The precise mechanisms by which microRNAs influence phenotype can be highly complex and manifold. Three of the six TRAP-mediated microRNAs identified in our results (hsa.miR.150, hsa.miR.29a and hsa.miR.29b) have been identified as having biological significance in studies of lung cancer,<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Leidinger_2012}</cite> although the biological roles they fulfil&nbsp; are intricate and it is incorrect to generalise them as being associated with increased risk. For example, hsa.miR.29a, which was shown to be downregulated by TRAP exposure in our results, has been associated with cancinogenesis in multiple studies, either as an inhibitor or as a promoter.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{LIU_2014,Nguyen_2011,Schmitt_2013,Wu_2013}</cite>&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="823113" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">mRNA</h3><div>The mRNA that was found to be downregulated by both PM10 and PM25 in our results –&nbsp;A_23_P77731 – is an expression of the CRYM gene<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{suite}</cite>. CRYM is a protein-coding gene associated with diseases including deafness, autosomal Dominant 40&nbsp;and&nbsp;Retinitis Pigmentosa 22.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="823113" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Adductomics</h3><div>Adductomics is a more recent addition to the OMICs field than metabolomics or transcriptomics, and there are comparatively few analytical analytical tools and sparser literature. However, one of the adductomics identified in our results as being positively mediated by TRAP exposure,&nbsp;d_107.1, has also been reported in the literature as being positively mediated by smoking.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Preston_2017}</cite> This suggests a potential common biological pathway towards DNA damage and mutation between TRAP exposure and smoking.</div><h2 data-label="873243" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><h2 data-label="873243" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multi-OMIC integration</h2><div>Figure X shows expression levels for each biomarker in each participant, with the Oxford street measurement on the bottom and the Hyde Park measurement on the top of the plot. Little difference in overall expression levels between the two sites can immediately be discerned – this is perhaps to be expected, and in keeping with the earlier observation that there is far more variation in exposure&nbsp;<i>within&nbsp;</i>locations than between them.</div><div></div>
