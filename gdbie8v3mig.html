<div>Conditional networks were also constructed to examine relationships between biomarkers, conditional on other biomarkers, and how these varied from the marginal analysis (as we expect a high degree of covariance between some groups of biomarkers). Further, differential networks were constructed to analyse how the structure varied between measurements taken at the two locations, and between groupings within the study participants â€“ notably health status.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="341398" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS)</h3><div>sPLS&nbsp;was implemented as a feature selection technique on the sets of significant biomarkers, specfically to identify pa. In this case, both [X] and [Y] are sets of biomarkers from different of OMICs levels identified by GLS as having&nbsp;significant univariate associations with delta-exposure; sPLS then applies sparsity on [X], resulting in a subset of OMICs within each level that is most relevant in describing [Y], another OMIC level. This sparse subset of OMICs, [X], is&nbsp;represented as a linear&nbsp;combination of the OMICs variables that&nbsp;make up the latent variables, or principal components (PCs), that maximises the covariance between [X] and [Y]. Consequently, the final sPLS model requires two optimised parameters: i)&nbsp;the number of components ii) the number of [X] variables to include in those components. This is achieved through a calibration procedure, repeated 100 times, in which the "best" number of components is chosen based on the highest Q2&nbsp;score, and the "best" number of variables to be included in those components is based on the lowest mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) score.&nbsp;Additionally, a multilevel extension of sPLS was used to account for the intraindividual variance imparted by the repeated measurements performed on each subject. This multilevel extension is defined by a design matrix linking a particular OMIC measurement a subject (patient ID). The same sPLS analysis was then stratified by locations to see if OMIC markers relate differently to each other in Oxford Street versus Hyde&nbsp;Park, and to obtain a set of results that are comparable to OMIC markers identified by differential networks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="250573" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>In the univariate analysis, one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and two adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure.&nbsp; The single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomic were found to be significantly associated with more than one TRAP.
