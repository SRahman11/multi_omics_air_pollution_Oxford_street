<div>Conditional networks were also constructed to examine relationships between biomarkers, conditional on other biomarkers, and how these varied from the marginal analysis (as we expect a high degree of covariance between some groups of biomarkers). Further, differential networks were constructed to analyse how the structure varied between measurements taken at the two locations, and between groupings within the study participants â€“ notably health status.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="341398" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS)</h3><div>sPLS&nbsp;was implemented as a feature selection technique on the sets of significant biomarkers to investigate patterns of covariance between<i>&nbsp;</i>OMICs levels. In our models, both [X] and [Y] are sets of biomarkers from different levels of OMICs  identified by the GLS model as having&nbsp;significant univariate associations with delta-exposure; sPLS then applies sparsity on [X], resulting in a subset of OMICs within each level that is most relevant in describing [Y], another OMIC level. The resulting sparse subset of [X] features from PLS regression is represented as a latent variable, composed as a linear combination of the input OMIC that maximises the covariance between [X] and [Y]. Accordingly, to obtain such results from the final sPLS model requires calibration of two parameters: i)&nbsp;the best component ii) the number of [X] variables to include in the best component. This is achieved through a calibration procedure, repeated 100 times, in which the "best" component to use is chosen based on the highest Q2&nbsp;score, and the "best" number of variables to be included in that component is based on the lowest mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) score.&nbsp;Additionally, a multilevel extension of sPLS was used&nbsp;to account for the intra-individual variance imparted by the repeated measurements performed on each subject. This multilevel extension is defined by a design matrix that states the number of repeated measurement taken for each subject. The same sPLS analysis was then stratified by location (Oxford streetto see if OMIC markers relate differently to each other in Oxford Street versus Hyde&nbsp;Park, and to obtain a set of results that are comparable to OMIC markers identified by differential networks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="250573" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>In the univariate analysis, one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and two adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure.&nbsp; The single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomic were found to be significantly associated with more than one TRAP.
