<div>These selected metabolite and miRNA markers form the linear combination of features retained by the 'best' component according to the Q2 criterion (see methods). The variances explained by these retained components, unstratified and stratified by location are shown in figure 19 and 20, respectively.&nbsp; Both figures have three parts, the top part shows the proportion of variance in X explained by the retained X component, the middle part shows the proportion of variance in Y explained by the same component, and the bottom part shows the proportion of variance in Y explained by the corresponding retained Y component.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>Show the explained variances and Q2 scores first. Explained variances show the summary of the models. - talk about no predictive power because variance explained is very low. Back this up with Q2 score</div><div></div><div></div>
