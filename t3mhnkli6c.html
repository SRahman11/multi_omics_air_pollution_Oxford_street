<div>These selected metabolite and miRNA markers form the linear combination of features retained by the 'best' component according to the Q2 criterion (see methods). The variances explained by these retained components, unstratified and stratified by location are shown in figure 19 and 20, respectively.&nbsp; These figures have three parts, the top part shows the proportion of variance in X explained by the retained X component, the middle part shows the same component explaining the proporition variance in Y, and the bottom part shows the corresponding Y component explaining the variance in Y.</div><div></div><div>The top part of both figures shows the proportion of variance in Y explained by the retained X component, the middle part shows the proportion of variance in Y explained by retained X, and the bottom part shows the variance in Y&nbsp; by Y, explained by the retained component according to the Q2 criterion.

Explained variances show the summary of the models. - talk about no predictive power because variance explained is very low. Back this up with Q2 score</div>
