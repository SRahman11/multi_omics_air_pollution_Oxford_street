<div>These selected metabolite and miRNA markers are the linear combination of features retained by the 'best' component according to the Q2 criterion (see methods). The variances explained by these retained components, unstratified and stratified by location are shown in figure 19 and 20, respectively.&nbsp; Both figures have three sections, the top sectionshows the proportion of variance in X explained by the retained X component, the middle part shows the proportion of variance in Y explained by the same component, and the bottom part shows the proportion of variance in Y explained by the corresponding retained Y component.&nbsp;</div>
