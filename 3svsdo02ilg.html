<div>The proportion of variance in multivariate Y explained by the retained X component is  low, with most of the explored OMIC pairs showing less than 5% explanatory performance. The highest OMIC pair being metabolite (X) and mRNA (Y), in which the retained component selected 9/214 metabolites to explain 10.4% of the variation in Y, which is one mRNA. However, when stratified by location, across all the OMIC pairs, the proportion of variance in Y explained by X increased significantly,   indicating  perturbation of biological pathways by TRAP exposure. </div><div>Figures 21 and 22 show how the loadings&nbsp;</div><div></div>
