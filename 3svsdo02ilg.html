<div>The proportion of variance in multivariate Y explained by the retained X component is  low, with most of the explored OMIC pairs showing less than 5% explanatory performance. The highest OMIC pair being metabolite (X) and mRNA (Y), in which the retained component selected 10/214 metabolites to explain 10.4% of the variation in Y, which is one mRNA. However, when stratified by location, across all the OMIC pairs, the proportion of variance in Y explained by X increased significantly,   indicating  perturbation of biological pathways by TRAP exposure.&nbsp;Figures 21 and 22 show how the loadings of sare different in the location-stratified models for miRNA(X)-metabolites(Y) and miRNA(X)-mRNA(Y), respectively.</div><div></div>
