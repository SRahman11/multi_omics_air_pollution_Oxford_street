<div>Looking at figure 19 (mid-part), the proportion of variance in multivariate Y explained by the retained X component is questionably low, with most of the explored OMIC pairs showing less than 5% explanatory performance. The highest OMIC pair being metabolite (X) and mRNA (Y), in which the retained component selected 9/214 metabolites to explain 10.4% of the variation in Y, which is one mRNA. However, when stratified by location, across all the OMIC pairs, the proportion of variance in Y explained by X increased significantly, which again indicates the confounding effect of location. This effect is expected since Oxford street and Hyde Park have very different levels of TRAP exposure. </div><div></div><div>To investigate if the explained variation in Y by the selected markers also provided good predictive performance, which would indicate the significance of the selected markers, Q2 scores of each model is shown in Figure 21. All models either show a negative or an almost negligible , which  indicates no predictive relevance by the underlying selected markers or an almost negligible Q2 score, ranging from 0.003 to 0.067, which would indicate very weak predictive relevance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{rr2009}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>No models show a Q2 score above 0.07, thus indicating weak predictive relevance of the selected markers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
