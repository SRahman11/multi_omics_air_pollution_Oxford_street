<div>Looking at figure 19 (mid-part), the proportion of variance in multivariate Y explained by the retained X component is questionably low, with most of the explored OMIC pairs showing less than 5% explanatory performance. The highest OMIC pair being metabolite (X) and mRNA (Y), in which the retained component selected 9/214 metabolites to explain 10.4% of the variation in Y, which is one mRNA. However, when stratified by location, across all the OMIC pairs, the proportion of variance in Y explained by X increased significantly, which again indicates the confounding effect of location. This effect is expected since Oxford street and Hyde Park have very different levels of TRAP exposure. </div><div></div><div>To investigate if the explained variation in Y by the selected markers also provided good predictive performance, which would indicate the significance of the selected markers, Q2 scores of each model is shown in Figure 21.&nbsp;</div>
