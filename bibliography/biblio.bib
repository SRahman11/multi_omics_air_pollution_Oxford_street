The combined effects of ambient (outdoor) and household air pollution cause about 7.0 million premature deaths every year, largely as a result of increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections. Low- and middle-income countries suffer from the highest  air pollution exposures, indoors and outside.  In most low- and middle-income cities fine particulate concentrations exceed WHO guideline levels of 10 micrograms per cubic metre (10 ug/m3).},
