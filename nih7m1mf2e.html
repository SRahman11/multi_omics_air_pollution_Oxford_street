The first step was to run an univariate analysis to explore the relationships between each short term exposure to the different- OMIC levels separately for 50 participants.</div><div></div><div>Results from our univariate analysis show that, &nbsp;one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and 2 adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure. For the single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomic &nbsp;were significantly associated with more than one TRAP. &nbsp; Further analysis were conducted in Results reported by our analysis generally support results found in published literature on the topic.</div><div></div><div>TRAP-associated metabolites were analysed using the mummichog algorithm at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metaboanalyst.ca/">https://www.metaboanalyst.ca</a>&nbsp;to predict functional activity. Five metabolomic pathways were identified as having significant levels of metabolomic modification in our results. Figure X shows visually the pathway activity profile, with significant pathways identified. Table X shows all pathways affected by metabolomic biomarkers in our results.</div>
