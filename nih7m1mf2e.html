<h1 data-label="316758" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="316758" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div>Our study entailed a two step strategy to explore the effects of short-term exposure to air pollution at a multi-OMIC level. The first step was to run an univariate analysis to explore the relationships between each short term exposure to the different- OMIC levels separately for 50 participants.</div><div></div><div>Results from our univariate analysis show that, &nbsp;one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and 2 adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure. For the single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomic &nbsp;were significantly associated with more than one TRAP. &nbsp; Further analysis were conducted to try annotate and map the functional activity of the mRNA, miRNAs, metabolites and adductomic that were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure. The results reported by our analysis generally support results found in published literature on the topic.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="806417" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Metabolites</h3><div>Functional analysis of the TRAP-associated metabolites showed significant mediation of five metabolomic pathways, most significantly the lipoate metabolism and the vitamin E metabolism.</div><div>It has been shown that enzymes affected by the lipoate metabolism are integral in cancer metabolism<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bingham_2014,Zachar_2011}</cite>. &nbsp;Studies have<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{copd}</cite></div><div></div><div>The vitamin E metabolism has also been shown to be associated with C</div><div></div><h3>MicroRNAs</h3><div>The precise mechanisms by which microRNAs influence phenotype can be highly complex and manifold. Three of the six TRAP-mediated microRNAs identified in our results (hsa.miR.150, hsa.miR.29a and hsa.miR.29b) have been identified as having biological significance in studies of lung cancer,<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Leidinger_2012}</cite> although the biological roles they fulfil&nbsp; are intricate and it is incorrect to generalise them as being associated with increased risk. For example, hsa.miR.29a, which was shown to be downregulated by TRAP exposure in our results, has been associated with cancinogenesis in multiple studies, either as an inhibitor or as a promoter.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{LIU_2014,Nguyen_2011,Schmitt_2013,Wu_2013}</cite>&nbsp;</div>
