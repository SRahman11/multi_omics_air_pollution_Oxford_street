<h1 data-label="316758" class="ltx_title_section"></h1><h1 data-label="316758" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div>Our study entailed a two step strategy to explore the effects of short-term exposure to air pollution at a multi-OMIC level. The first step was to run an univariate analysis to explore the relationships between each short term exposure to the different- OMIC levels separately for 50 participants.</div><div></div><div>Results from our univariate analysis show that, &nbsp;one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and 2 adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure. For the single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomic &nbsp;were significantly associated with more than one TRAP.&nbsp;From our multivariate analyses, &nbsp;where we ran the sPLS model on the data that had been denoised for biological and technical confounders we found that &nbsp;there were some significance reported amongst metabolites, adductomics and &nbsp;mRNA. For instance, as seen from the results section (Figure 18)</div><div></div><div></div><h3 data-label="806417" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Metabolites</h3><div>Functional analysis of the TRAP-associated metabolites showed significant mediation of five metabolomic pathways, most significantly the lipoate metabolism and the vitamin E metabolism.</div><div>It has been shown that enzymes affected by the lipoate metabolism are integral in cancer metabolism<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bingham_2014,Zachar_2011}</cite>.&nbsp; The vitamin E metabolism has also been shown to be associated with COPD&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Al_Azzawi_2017,Lee_2015}</cite>.</div><div></div><h3>MicroRNAs</h3><div>The precise mechanisms by which microRNAs influence phenotype can be highly complex and manifold. Three of the six TRAP-mediated microRNAs identified in our results (hsa.miR.150, hsa.miR.29a and hsa.miR.29b) have been identified as having biological significance in studies of lung cancer,<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Leidinger_2012}</cite> although the biological roles they fulfil&nbsp; are intricate and it is incorrect to generalise them as being associated with increased risk. For example, hsa.miR.29a, which was shown to be downregulated by TRAP exposure in our results, has been associated with cancinogenesis in multiple studies, either as an inhibitor or as a promoter.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{LIU_2014,Nguyen_2011,Schmitt_2013,Wu_2013}</cite>&nbsp;</div>
