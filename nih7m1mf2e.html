Three of the six TRAP-mediated microRNAs identified in our results (hsa.miR.150, hsa.miR.29a and hsa.miR.29b) have been identified as having biological significance in studies of lung cancer,<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Leidinger_2012}</cite> although the biological roles they fulfil&nbsp; are intricate and it is incorrect to generalise them as being associated with increased risk. For example, hsa.miR.29a, which was shown to be downregulated by TRAP exposure in our results, has been associated with cancinogenesis in multiple studies, either as an inhibitor or as a promoter.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{LIU_2014,Nguyen_2011,Schmitt_2013,Wu_2013}</cite>&nbsp;</div>
