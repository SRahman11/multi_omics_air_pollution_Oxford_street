The first step was to run an univariate analysis to explore the relationships between each short term exposure to the different- OMIC levels separately for 50 participants.</div><div></div><div>Results from our univariate analysis show that, &nbsp;one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and 2 adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure. For the single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomic &nbsp;were significantly associated with more than one TRAP. &nbsp; Further analysis were conducted to try annotate and map the functional activity of the mRNA, miRNAs, metabolites and adductomic that were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure. The results reported by our analysis generally support results found in published literature on the topic.</div><div></div><div></div>
