A cohort of 119 patients were recruited to the trial; 40 of these patients were healthy and were recruited by advertising in the Royal Brompton Hospital; 40 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 39 had ischaemic heart disease (IHD). The patients with pre-existing health conditions were recruited from existing databases or outpatient clinics at the&nbsp;Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sinharay_2018}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Each participant in the study was randomly assigned to one of two locations – Oxford Street and Hyde Park – in London, and driven to that location by electric car. They then walked for two hours in their allotted location, pausing to rest for 15 minutes every half an hour. The total distance walked was approximately 6 kilometres. Between 3 and 8 weeks later, the participants were taken to the other location and completed the same distance and duration of walk.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="237755" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Exposure measurement</h3><div>At the start and end of each walk session, concentrations of five TRAP particles were gauged using appropriate particulate matter measurement devices (full details can be found in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sinharay_2018}</cite>). </div><div>Average baseline levels of exposure to the five TRAP particles were generated for each participant using a modelling process,&nbsp; and the differences between these baseline levels as the measured exposure levels, accounting for a lagging effect, were used in the analysis.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="187916" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">OMICs measurement</h3><div>For each participant and session, blood serum samples were collected at two hours before the walk, two hours after, and 24 hours after, from which multi-omics measurements were taken, such as,&nbsp; metabolomics, transcriptomics (mRNA and miRNA), and&nbsp;adductomics.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="308247" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Covariates</h3><div>For each participant, measurements were taken for height, weight, BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), disystolic blood pressure (DBP) and recent caffeine intake.</div><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="541615" class="ltx_title_subsection">Statistical analysis</h2><div>After removing observations for any participants who were current smokers or who had incomplete measurements,&nbsp;</div><div></div>
