Univariate models were used to investigate the association between 5 reported TRAPS (NO2, CO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CBLK) and biomarkers at four OMICs levels. Network analysis and partial least squares regression were used to investigate and visualise the relationships between significant markers at different OMIC levels.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="148765" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Results</h3><div>One mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and 2 adductomics were found to be significantly associated with at least one TRAP exposure.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 4.2 million people die each year as a&nbsp;direct&nbsp;consequence of ambient (outdoor) air pollution<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{pollution}</cite>, and traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs) make up a large proportion of this pollution.</div><div></div><div>Short-term exposure to TRAPs has also been shown to have acute negative health effects, especially in patients with pre-existing respiratory or cardiac conditions&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{McCreanor_2007,Laumbach_2014,Cole_Hunter_2015}</cite>. The advent in the 21st century of high-throughput OMICs technologies has facilitated the investigation of associations between environmental exposures and biological responses at a cellular level, with the result that biological pathways can be mapped with  precision, and the links between exposure and outcome examined in detail. Recent research has therefore begun to focus on investigating the effects of TRAP exposure at a molecular level, using OMICs-derived methods of computational and statistical analysis&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van_Veldhoven_2019,Alfano_2018,Mostafavi_2018,Esp_n_P_rez_2018,Krauskopf_2018,Krauskopf_2018a}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>In this study, we investigate the effects of short-term exposure to air pollution at a multi-OMIC level. Measured exposures are five TRAP particles: PM10, PM25, black carbon (CBLK), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ultrafine particles (PCNT). Molecular responses are&nbsp;analysed at the transcriptomic level (mRNA and miRNA), the metabolomic level and the&nbsp;adductomic level,&nbsp; and a multi-OMICs integrative analysis is conducted to attempt to identify evidence of biological mechanisms linking OMICs levels.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="542274" class="ltx_title_section">Methods</h1><div>This study used a randomised crossover interventional study design. A cohort of 119 patients were recruited to the trial: 40 of these patients were healthy and were recruited by advertising in the Royal Brompton Hospital; 40 had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and 39 had ischaemic heart disease (IHD). The patients with pre-existing health conditions were recruited from existing databases or outpatient clinics at the&nbsp;Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sinharay_2018}</cite>.</div><div></div><div>Each participant in the study was randomly assigned to one of two locations – Oxford Street or Hyde Park – in London, and driven to that location by electric car. They then walked for two hours in their allotted location, pausing to rest for 15 minutes every half an hour. The total distance walked was approximately 6 kilometres. Between 3 and 8 weeks later, the participants were taken to the other location and completed the same distance and duration of walk.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="237755" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Exposure measurement</h3><div>At the start and end of each walk session, atmospheric concentrations of five TRAP particles were gauged using appropriate particulate matter measurement devices (full details can be found in Sinhray et al, 2018<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Sinharay_2018}</cite>).&nbsp;</div><div> Figure 1 shows the distribution of particulate measurements across the two sites, measured during the walks.
