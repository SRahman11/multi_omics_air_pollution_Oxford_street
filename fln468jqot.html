<div>Q2 scores of each final, calibrated model are shown in Figure 18. All unstratified models either show a negative or an almost negligible Q2 score,  indicating no or weak predictive relevance by the underlying selected markers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{rr2009}</cite>.&nbsp; Stratifying by location tends to substantially improve the models,, metabolite(X)-adducts(Y), metabolite(X)-miRNA(Y), miRNA(X)-mRNA(Y), and miRNA(X)-metabolite(Y).</div>
