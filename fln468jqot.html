<div>Figure 18 shows the number of selected OMIC markers by sPLS on X with non-zero loading coefficients for each of the explored OMIC pairs, unstratified and stratified by location. From this table, it can be seen that when stratified by location, the model tends to select more metabolites, suggesting that location imparts a mixture effect that when disentangled revealed more metabolite markers with positive loadings that contribute to the explained variance in Y.Fig. 18</div>
