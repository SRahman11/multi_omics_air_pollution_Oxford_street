<div>Figure 18 shows the number of X OMIC markers selected by the multilevel sPLS model with non-zero loadings for each of the explored OMIC pairs, unstratified and stratified by location. When stratified by location, the model tends to select more metabolites, indicating  perturbation of biological pathways by TRAP exposure.</div><div></div>
