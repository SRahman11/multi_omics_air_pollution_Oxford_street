<div>The number of selected X Omics selected by the calibrated sPLS model that covary most with multivariate [Y] Omics is shown in Figure 18. From this table, it can be seen that when stratified by location, the model tends to select more metabolites, suggesting the disentanglement of the mixture effect of location helped identify more mea</div><div></div><div>Show the explained variances and Q2 scores first.
