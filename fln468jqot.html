<div>Q2 scores of each model is shown in Figure 21. All uns models either show a negative or an almost negligible Q2 score,  indicating no or weak predictive relevance by the underlying selected markers&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{rr2009}</cite>.&nbsp; A note of interest is seen in the metabolite(X)-Adduct(Y) model, in which the unstratified model, with negative Q2 score, shows no predictive performance by the retained component; however, when stratified by location, the model's Q2 score became positive suggesting better predictive performance. This same effect is also observed in three other OMIC pair models, metabolite(X)-miRNA(Y), miRNA(X)-mRNA(Y), and miRNA(X)-metabolite(Y). Once again, this shows the confounding effect of location.</div>
