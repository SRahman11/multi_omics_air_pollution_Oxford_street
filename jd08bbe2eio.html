<ul><li>There are subsets of X that relates to Y</li><li>Explain why Adducts as X can only be ran against mRNA, need at least 3 dimensions in X when Y has more dimensions than X, hence, doesn't work when Y is miRNA or metabolites</li><li>In metabolomics as X, there is no overlap. Meaning each set of Y OMICs relates to different metabolites.</li><li>In Adducts, both adducts are always chosen. Not very informative. Though we can plot their loadings as X against each Y to examine positive or negative correlation to different sets of Y OMICs.&nbsp;The interpretation would be in the discussion section</li><li>In miRNA, there are some overlaps. Again could plot their loadings as X to see&nbsp;positive or negative correlation.
