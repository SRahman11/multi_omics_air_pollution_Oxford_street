<h3></h3><h3>Adductomics</h3><div>Adductomics is a more recent addition to the OMICs field than metabolomics or transcriptomics, and there are comparatively few analytical analytical tools and sparser literature. However, one of the adductomics identified in our results as being positively mediated by TRAP exposure,&nbsp;d_107.1, has also been reported in the literature as being positively mediated by smoking.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Preston_2017}</cite> This again indicates a potential common biological pathway towards DNA damage and mutation between TRAP exposure and smoking as was indicated in the functional metabolomic analysis. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="191345" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Integration</h3><div>Network analysis showed strong patterns of correlation and clustering of markers&nbsp;<i>within&nbsp;</i>OMICs levels, but limited inter-</div><div></div><div></div><div>From our multivariate analyses, &nbsp;where we ran the sPLS model on the data that had been denoised for biological and technical confounders we found that &nbsp;there were some significance reported amongst metabolites, adductomics and &nbsp;miRNA mainly. &nbsp;For example, as seen in Figure 17{describe some PLS] here.</div><div>From our network analysis we can see that that there is no clear pattern of significance between the different compounds and traps. The most interesting network analysis is seen in Figure 15, where associations between TRAP-associated biomarkers were stratified according to health status COPD/IHD/Healthy. From figure 15 we can deduce clear clusters of metabolites whose relationships are significant by health status, suggesting that the metabolic response to TRAP associated exposures in each of the three groups is similar within groups and different between the groups, according to health status.&nbsp;Discuss more about networks here</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="167044" class="ltx_title_section">key messages (as notes for us as we write this)</h1>
