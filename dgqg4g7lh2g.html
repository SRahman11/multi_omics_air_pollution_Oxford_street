<h3></h3><h3>Adductomics</h3><div>Adductomics is a more recent addition to the OMICs field than metabolomics or transcriptomics, and there are comparatively few analytical analytical tools and sparser literature. However, one of the adductomics identified in our results as being positively mediated by TRAP exposure,&nbsp;d_107.1, has also been reported in the literature as being positively mediated by smoking.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Preston_2017}</cite> This again indicates a potential common biological pathway towards DNA damage and mutation between TRAP exposure and smoking as was indicated in the functional metabolomic analysis. We developed networks to provide an integrative approach to the analysis. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="191345" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Integration</h3><div>From our multivariate analyses, &nbsp;where we ran the sPLS model on the data that had been denoised for biological and technical confounders we found that &nbsp;there were some significance reported amongst metabolites, adductomics and &nbsp;miRNA mainly. &nbsp;For example, as seen in Figure 17{describe some PLS] here.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="167044" class="ltx_title_section">key messages (as notes for us as we write this)</h1>
