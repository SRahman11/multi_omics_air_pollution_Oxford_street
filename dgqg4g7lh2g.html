<h3></h3><h3>Adductomics</h3><div>Adductomics is a more recent addition to the OMICs field than metabolomics or transcriptomics, and there are comparatively few analytical analytical tools and sparser literature. However, one of the adductomics identified in our results as being positively mediated by TRAP exposure,&nbsp;d_107.1, has also been reported in the literature as being positively mediated by smoking.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Preston_2017}</cite> This again indicates a potential common biological pathway towards DNA damage and mutation between TRAP exposure and smoking as was indicated in the functional metabolomic analysis. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="191345" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Integration</h3><div>Network analysis showed strong patterns of correlation and clustering of markers&nbsp;<i>within&nbsp;</i>OMICs levels, but limited significant inter-OMIC correlation. Differentiation by health status offered the most interesting results and indicated&nbsp;clear clusters of metabolites whose relationships are significantly altered by health status, suggesting that the metabolic response to TRAP associated exposures in each of the three groups is similar within groups and different between the groups.</div><div></div><div>sPLS modelling revealed limited covariance between OMICs levels, although the stratified models showed some interesting differential relationships between OMICs levels.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In conclusion, our univariate analysis revealed some interesting specific marker-TRAP relationships, and functional analysis and comparison with previous published research suggests&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="494674" class="ltx_title_section">Limitations</h1><div>Univariate analysis  is, by definition, a restrictive way of investigating relationships between exposures and biomarkers, as we are aware that the OMICs data is highly structured, with regions of significant codependence. The identified metabolites, in particular, are highly correlated with each other. For further research, multivariate methods of identifying interesting markers may complement the results.</div><div>There are also anomalies in the exposure data: the measured exposure to NO2 during the walks (labelled "after_1" in figure 4) appears to be&nbsp;<i>below&nbsp;</i>modelled background exposure for almost every participant, which seems highly improbable. This may be due to a bug or error at the data collection/transfer stages and requires further investigation.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="106599" class="ltx_title_section">Data and code</h1><div>All R scripts for the analysis conducted in this study are available on GitHub:&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{biological-responses-to-short-term-exposure-to-air-pollution-a-multi-level-omics-analysis}</cite><a href="https://github.com/mathzero/Biological-responses-to-short-term-exposure-to-air-pollution-a-multi-level-OMICs-analysis">https://github.com/mathzero/Biological-responses-to-short-term-exposure-to-air-pollution-a-multi-level-OMICs-analysis</a></div>
