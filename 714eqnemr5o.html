<div>The metabolomic biomarkers identified as significant largely support previously published single-OMIC analysis of the same metabolomic data set<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{van_Veldhoven_2019}</cite>. A total of 24 of the 31 metabolites identified as significantly associated with TRAP exposure in Veldhoven&nbsp;<i>et al</i> are also identified in this analysis (and, notably, the previously identified metabolites are generally those with the strongest statistical significance in this analysis). Discrepancies probably arise from differential selection criteria for participants in&nbsp;Veldhoven&nbsp;<i>et al</i>, combined with a stricter false discovery control in&nbsp;Veldhoven&nbsp;<i>et al&nbsp;</i>(Bonferroni correction at 5%).</div><h2 data-label="873243" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>At the miRNA level, only one of the identified biomarkers matches results from a previously published single-OMIC analysis of the same miRNA data (Krauskopf 2018<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krauskopf2018}</cite>). In this case, the discrepancy is probably a result of even more stringent selection criteria in the previously published study (<i>n</i>=24 in Krauskopf <i>et al;&nbsp;</i>participants were actively selected on the basis of maximal difference in exposure levels between their two walks.
