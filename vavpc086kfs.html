Measured exposures are five TRAP particles: PM10, PM25, black carbon (CBLK), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ultrafine particles (PCNT). Molecular responses are&nbsp;analysed at the transcriptomic level (mRNA and miRNA), the metabolomic level and the&nbsp;adductomic level,&nbsp; and a multi-OMICs integrative analysis is conducted to attempt to identify evidence of biological mechanisms linking OMICs levels.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="494674" class="ltx_title_section">Limitations</h1><div>Univariate analysis  is, by definition, a restrictive way of investigating relationships between exposures and biomarkers, as we are aware that the OMICs data is highly structured, with regions of significant codependence.&nbsp;</div><div>There are also anomalies in the exposure data: the measured exposure to NO2 during the walks (labelled "after_1" in figure 4) appears to be&nbsp;<i>below&nbsp;</i>modelled background exposure for almost every participant, which seems highly improbable. This may be due to a bug or error at the data collection/transfer stages and requires further investigation.</div><div></div><div></div>
