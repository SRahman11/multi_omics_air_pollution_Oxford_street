A PLS approach, however,&nbsp; can be set up specifically to investigate structures of covariance between OMICs levels. Given that only one mRNA was found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure, sPLS with sparsity on X was applied only for the OMIC level pairs shown in Table 3.</div><div></div>
