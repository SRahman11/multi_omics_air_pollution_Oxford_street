<h3 data-label="369541" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Health status</h3><div>Analysis of the OMICs data reveals some structure relating to health status (healthy/CPOD/IHD), at each of the measured timepoints (both pre- and post-exposure), especially at the metabolomic level. Figure X shows each the outcome of a principal component analysis of the metabolomic data: the first two principal components for each observation are plotted at the three time points (before exposure, after exposure, and 24 hours after exposure). Clustering by health status is clearly visible, and exposure demonstrably impacts the nature of the clustering. This suggests potential differential re</div>
