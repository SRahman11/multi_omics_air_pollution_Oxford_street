<ul><li>Explained Variance Table for Metabolites</li><li>For overlap, are the loadings different, indicating&nbsp;opposite&nbsp;correlations in relation to location</li><li>Any overlap of metabolites in one location across the 3 different Y OMICS? - Venn diagram, loadings? The loadings should&nbsp;theoretically be in the same direction across the three Y OMICs&nbsp;because&nbsp;same&nbsp;location would mean&nbsp;same exposure</li><li>Any overlap across both locations and all Y OMICs? this would indicate a background biological system being detected</li><li>Do the same for miRNA as metabolites</li></ul>
