<div></div><div>This analysis was repeated for every OMIC at each of the four OMICs levels: transcripts (miRNA and mRNA), metabolomics and adductomics.&nbsp;To mitigate against false discovery arising from multiple testing, p-values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method for false discovery rate control, set at&nbsp; 5%.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Benjamini_1995}</cite></div><div></div><h3 data-label="842352" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sensitivity analysis</h3><div>To assess the sensitivity of our analysis to outlier data points in the OMICs features, the analysis was run multiple times with caps on the OMICs features to remove outliers above or below specified percentiles (specifically, 5%, 10% and 20%). </div><div></div><h2 data-label="271422" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multi-OMIC integrative analysis</h2><div>The GLS model identified a set of biomarkers for each of the OMIC levels that have significant associations with the&nbsp;experimentally-induced change in TRAP exposure. Based on the assumption that individuals share common biological responses to TRAP pollutants, resulting in similar changes in OMICs measurements,&nbsp;integrative analysis then aims to discover any biological significance, statistically, that links the changes in one OMIC level to another. For example, the differential expression of a transcript mediating the change in&nbsp;measured levels of a metabolite. The integrative techniques applied were network analysis and sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression.</div><div></div><h3 data-label="554852" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sparse Partial Least Squares (sPLS)</h3><div>sPLS&nbsp;was implemented as a variable selection technique on the sets of significant OMICs. In this case, both [X] and [Y] are different sets of OMICs levels identified by GLS as having&nbsp;significant univariate associations with delta-exposure; sPLS then applies sparsity on [X], resulting in a subset of OMICs within each level that is most relevant in describing [Y], another OMIC level. This sparse subset of OMICs, [X], is&nbsp;represented as a linear&nbsp;combination of the OMICs variables that&nbsp;make up the latent variables, or principal components (PCs), that maximises the variance-covariance between [X] and [Y]. Consequently, the final sPLS model requires two optimised parameters: i)&nbsp;the number of components ii) the number of [X] variables to include in those components. This is achieved through a calibration procedure, repeated 100 times, in which the "best" number of components is chosen based on the highest Q2&nbsp;score, and the "best" number of variables to be included in those components is based on the lowest mean squared error of prediction (MSEP) score.&nbsp;Additionally, a multilevel extension of sPLS was used to account for the intraindividual variance imparted by the repeated measurements performed on each the subjects. </div><div></div><h3 data-label="375246" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Network Analysis</h3><div>To investigate and visualise biological pathways and relationships within and between OMICs levels, a range of network analysis techniques were applied. At the most basic level, marginal networks examined the pairwise relationships between biomarkers. P-values for covariance of each biomarker pairing were derived, and corrected for multiple testing using a Bonferroni adjustment. As four levels of OMIC were being analysed, the correlation matrix contained 10 inter-OMIC and intra-OMIC&nbsp;regions, and each region was adjusted for false discovery according to the size of the region (and therefore the number of tests conducted in that region). </div><div></div><div>Conditional networks were also constructed to examine relationships between biomarkers, conditional on other biomarkers, and how these varied from the marginal analysis (as we expect a high degree of covariance between some groups of biomarkers). Further, differential networks were constructed to analyse how the structure varied between measurements taken at the two locations, and between groupings within the study participants – notably health status.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="250573" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>In the univariate analysis, one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and two adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure.&nbsp; The single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomicwere found to be significantly associated with more than one TRAP.
