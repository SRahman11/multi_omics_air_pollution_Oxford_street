<div></div><div>This analysis was repeated for every OMIC at each of the four OMICs levels: transcripts (miRNA and mRNA), metabolomics and adductomics.&nbsp;To mitigate against false discovery arising from multiple testing, p-values were corrected using the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg method for false discovery rate control, set at&nbsp; 5%.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Benjamini_1995}</cite></div><div></div><h3 data-label="842352" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sensitivity analysis</h3><div>To assess the sensitivity of our analysis to outlier data points in the OMICs features, the analysis was run multiple times with caps on the OMICs features to remove outliers above or below specified percentiles (specifically, 5%, 10% and 20%). </div><div></div><h2 data-label="271422" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multi-OMIC integrative analysis</h2><div>The GLS model identified a set of biomarkers for each of the OMIC levels that have significant associations with the&nbsp;experimentally-induced change in TRAP exposure. Based on the assumption that individuals share common biological responses to TRAP pollutants, resulting in similar changes in OMICs measurements,&nbsp;integrative analysis then aims to discover any biological significance, statistically, that links the changes in one OMIC level to another. For example, the differential expression of a transcript mediating the change in&nbsp;measured levels of a metabolite.

In this case, both [X] and [Y] are different sets of OMICs levels identified by GLS as having&nbsp;significant univariate associations with delta-exposure; sPLS then applies sparsity on [X], resulting in a subset of OMICs within each level that is most relevant in describing [Y], another OMIC level.

At the most basic level, marginal networks examined the pairwise relationships between biomarkers. Conditional networks were also constructed to examine relationships between biomarkers, conditional on other biomarkers, and how these varied from the partial analysis (as we expect a high degree of covariance between some groups of biomarkers). Further, conditional networks were constructed to analyse how the structure varied between measurements taken at</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="250573" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>In the univariate analysis, one mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and two adductomics were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure.&nbsp; The single mRNA, three metabolites and one adductomicwere found to be significantly associated with more than one TRAP.
