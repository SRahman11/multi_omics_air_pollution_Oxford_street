<div></div><div>This analysis was repeated for every OMIC at each of the four OMICs levels: transcripts (miRNA and mRNA), metabolomics and adductomics.&nbsp;To mitigate against false discovery arising from multiple testing, p-values were corrected using the Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg method for false discovery rate control, set at&nbsp; 5%.<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Benjamini_1995}</cite></div><div></div><h3 data-label="842352" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sensitivity analysis</h3><div>To assess the sensitivity of our analysis to outlier data points in the OMICs features, the analysis was run multiple times with caps on the OMICs features to remove outliers above or below specified percentiles (specifically, 5%, 10% and 20%). </div><div></div><h2 data-label="271422" class="ltx_title_subsection">Multi-OMIC integrative analysis</h2><div>The GLS model identified a set of biomarkers for each of the OMIC levels that have significant associations with the&nbsp;experimentally-induced change in TRAP exposure. Based on the assumption that individuals share common biological responses to TRAP pollutants, resulting in similar changes in OMICs measurements,&nbsp;integrative analysis then aims to discover any biological significance, statistically, that links the changes in one OMIC level to another. For example, the differential expression of a transcript mediating the change in&nbsp;measured levels of a metabolite. The integrative techniques applied were network analysis and sparse partial least squares (sPLS) regression. Network analysis takes a broad perspective and isolates statistically significant linkages within and between OMICs levels, while sPLS focuses specifically on&nbsp;<i>between-</i>OMIC associations.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h3 data-label="776082" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Network Analysis</h3>
