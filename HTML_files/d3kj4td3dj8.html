<ul><li>Explain why Adducts as X can only be ran against mRNA, need at least 3 dimensions in X when Y has more dimensions than X, hence, doesn't work when Y is miRNA or metabolites</li><li>In metabolomics as X, there is 2 overlap. </li><li>In miRNA, there are some overlaps. Again could plot their loadings as X to see&nbsp;positive or negative correlation. Interpretation in discussion</li></ul>
