<div>Prior to analysis, OMICs data were de-noised against relevant technical confounders (batch and array in the case of transcripts, for example).&nbsp;Average baseline concentration of air&nbsp;pollutants one year&nbsp; prior to the experiment was modelled to represent the background or long-term TRAP exposure, and differences between the modelled baseline levels and the measured exposure levels, accounting for a lagging effect, were used in the analysis so any significant&nbsp;association would represent an OMIC feature whose intensity had been mediated by the experimentally-induced change in exposure&nbsp;levels.</div>
