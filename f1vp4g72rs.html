<div>Prior to analysis, OMICs data were de-noised against relevant technical confounders (batch and array in the case of transcripts, for example).&nbsp;Average baseline concentration of air&nbsp;pollutants one year prior to the experiment was modelled to represent the background or long-term TRAP exposure, and differences between the modelled baseline levels and the measured exposure levels, accounting for a lagging effect, were used in the analysis so any significant&nbsp;association would represent an OMIC feature whose intensity had been mediated by the experimentally-induced change in exposure&nbsp;levels. Then, each individual OMIC was regressed in a univariate model against delta between the real-time TRAP measurement and the modelled background TRAP measurement, controlling for potential confounders (age, sex, BMI, health status and caffeine intake). The delta was set to 0 for the first measurement – before the walk – as this disparity is not of interest.</div><div></div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Y\ \left[OMIC\right]\ =\ Exposure\left[background\right]\ +\ \beta\cdot Exposure\left[delta\right]\ +\left[confounders\right]\ \)</span></div><div></div><div>Figures 1 and 3 shows the merit of using a multivariate normal model of this nature rather than attempting explicitly to model the time and location (and interaction between the two) as variables: there is much more variation in exposure levels&nbsp;<i>among&nbsp;</i>the locations than between them, and there is not always a clear difference in exposure levels between the sites.</div><div></div>
