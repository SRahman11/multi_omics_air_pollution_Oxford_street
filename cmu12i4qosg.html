<h2 data-label="294068" class="ltx_title_subsection">sPLS Results</h2><div> The resulting set of OMICs from the GLS model represents biomarkers that show significant association with TRAP. Here, through the application of sparsity, sPLS attempts to identify subsets of markers within each OMIC level that show significant covariance with another subset of markers in another OMIC level. The results from such integration implies a common TRAP-mediated biological response that has caused these specific OMIC levels to show correlated fluctuations.&nbsp;</div><div>Given that only one mRNA and two adducts were found to be significantly associated with TRAP exposure, sparse PLS on X was not applied to mRNA and adducts, and only applied to the OMIC level pairs shown in Figure 17.</div>
