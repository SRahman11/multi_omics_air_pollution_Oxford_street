# Biological responses to short-term exposure to air pollution: a multi-level OMICs analysis

## Abstract
### Introduction
While the association between long-term negative health outcomes and air pollution has been established, short term exposure to air pollution and traffic-related air pollutants (TRAPs) has only recently been investigated. In this study we investigate the effects of short-term exposure to air pollution at a multi-omic level.
### Methods
Using a randomised crossover interventional study design, recruited participants were allocated to walk for two hours at one of two sites –Hyde Park or Oxford Street in Central London – where measurements of TRAP exposures and blood serum samples were collected before and after the walk. Univariate models were used to investigate the association between 5 reported TRAPS (NO2, CO2, PM2.5, PM10 and CBLK) and biomarkers at four OMICs levels. Network analysis and partial least squares regression were used to investigate and visualise the relationships between significant markers at different OMIC levels.
### Results
One mRNA, six miRNAs, 148 metabolites and two adducts ,mnnj bhmguygtg65tt4rertwere found to be significantly associated with at least one TRAP exposure. Investigations into relations between markers at different OMICs levels revealed some patterns of covariance that were intensified when analysis was stratified by exposure site, indicating perturbation of biological pathways by TRAP exposure.
### Discussion 
Functional analysis and comparison with previous published research suggest that the short-term molecular biological responses may have some relevance to longer-term health outcomes including cancer and COPD. Stratification by health status reveals interesting differential responses to exposure among healthy, COPD and IHD participants.
