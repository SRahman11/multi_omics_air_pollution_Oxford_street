<ul><li>There are subsets of X that relates to Y</li><li>Explain why Adducts as X can only be ran against mRNA, need at least 3 dimensions in X when Y has more dimensions than X, hence, doesn't work when Y is miRNA or metabolites</li><li>In metabolomics as X, there is no overlap.

Though we can plot their loadings as X against each Y to examine positive or negative correlation to different sets of Y OMICs.&nbsp;The interpretation would be in the discussion section</li><li>In miRNA, there are some overlaps.

Little difference in overall expression levels between the two sites can immediately be discerned â€“ this is perhaps to be expected, and in keeping with the earlier observation that there is far more variation in exposure&nbsp;<i>within&nbsp;</i>locations than between them.</div><div></div>
