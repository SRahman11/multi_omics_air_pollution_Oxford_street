<div></div><div>Prior to analysis, OMICs data were de-noised against relevant technical confounders (batch and array in the case of transcripts, for example). Then, each individual OMIC was regressed in a univariate model against delta between the real-time TRAP measurement and the modelled background TRAP measurement, controlling for potential confounders (age, sex, BMI, health status and caffeine intake). The delta was set to 0 for the first measurement – before the walk – as this disparity is not of interest.</div><div></div><div><span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(Y\ \left[OMIC\right]\ =\ Exposure\left[background\right]\ +\ \beta\cdot Exposure\left[delta\right]\ +\left[confounders\right]\ \)</span></div><div></div><div>This analysis was repeated for every OMIC at each of the four OMICs levels: transcripts (miRNA and mRNA), metabolomics and adductomics.&nbsp;To mitigate against false discovery arising from multiple testing, p-values were corrected using the Benjamini–Hochberg method for false discovery rate control.</div><div></div><div>Once a sparse set of biomarkers that were significantly associated with TRAP exposure had been identified from each OMIC level, integrative and network analysis was performed&nbsp; on these OMICs to try to identify biological pathways.</div>
