<h3>mRNA</h3><div>The mRNA that was found to be downregulated by both PM10 and PM25 in our results –&nbsp;A_23_P77731 – is an expression of the CRYM gene<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{suite}</cite>. CRYM is a protein-coding gene associated with diseases including deafness, autosomal dominant 40 (a type of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss) and retinitis pigmentosa 22 (a group of heritable eye diseases). Furthermore the CYRM gene is associated with the regulation of thyroid levels in the body and pituitary gland (<span class="au-background-yellow" data-background="true">references).</span> &nbsp;While there is no concrete scientific evidence, theories have suggested that the disregulation of thyroid levels can lead to systemic inflammation in the body and are correlated with the occurrence or exacerbation of COPD<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Abe2003}</cite><cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Miłkowska-Dymanowska2017}</cite>&nbsp;</div>
